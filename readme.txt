Automatically increase visitor engagement and pageviews with AI-powered content recommendations. No humans required.

== Description ==

Alter helps automatically increase visitor engagement and pageviews with AI-powered content recommendations. No humans required.

Alter generates 10X more engagement compared to traditional "related posts" plugins.

= Big Problem =

Every person is unique with their own interests and perspectives so why do most sites continue to push the same content to everyone (e.g. recent posts, popular posts, related posts, etc)? That's no different than trying to force everyone to wear the same clothes.

= Automated Solution =

Alter will automatically analyze your site and study your visitors. Then using AI-powered algorithms, it will recommend personalized content to your visitors based on their interests and behaviors to help keep them more engaged and spend more time on your site. It's the perfect way to increase pageviews.

= Manual Override =

Not ready for autopilot? Want to control content being recommended to your visitors? We've got you covered. You can activate, deactivate, and prioritize content at any time. You're always in complete control.

= Custom Branding =

We understand every website is unique. This is why our software is programmed to automatically match your website's branding. You can also upload a custom background image for your recommendation widget.

= Clear Results =

Alter will study your existing traffic and use that data to calculate the increase in visitor engagement and conversions, allowing you to easily see the impact our software has had on your bottom line.
